# Python-for-Data-Analytics

These Python for Data Analytics notebooks are divided into two parts. Part 1 (Introduction to Python) covers the Python programming language and introductory programming concepts. Part 2 (Python for Data Analytics) covers more advanced material about the numpy package for scientific computing.

You should attempt to complete all of the exercises in Part 1. We also advise that you attempt the exercises in Part 2, they provide information that will be very useful for your course, but they may prove to be too complicated at this stage. If that's the case then you can revisit them later.
