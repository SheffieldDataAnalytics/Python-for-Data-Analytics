A particular case to be careful of is integer division, where both numbers are integers, e.g. try entering 2/3 - what result do you get and why?

For example, we might use a variable named **balance** to store our bank balance as a foating point number, or a variable named **message** to store a string that is to be printed as a message. Using meaningful variable names makes your code much more readable and understandable, and is a key feature of good programming style. It not only helps someone else to understand your code (e.g. me, if I'm marking it), it also helps **you** understand your own code, which is vital if you're trying to figure out why it doesn't work, or does something that you're not expecting. Note that variable names can contain letters, digits and underscores (i.e. _), but must begin with a letter. Note also that there are some special words, Python's keywords, that cannot be used as variable names."
