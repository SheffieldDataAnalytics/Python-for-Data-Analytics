    "* To gain experience with some more advanced Python programming features: passing functions as parameters; defining 'anonymous’ functions.\n",
    "* To see how numerical integration can be used to approximate the [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean) and [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) of a distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Background ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Expectations of continuous random variables (e.g. means and variances) can be computed from the probability density function by integration. ‘Analytic’ integration can be used to derive exact expressions for the mean and variance of the Gaussian distribution and the uniform distribution. Sometimes integration can be hard to perform analytically. In such cases it is possible to resort to approximate numerical techniques to compute the mean and variance. There are two main approaches that can take:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>[monte-carlo sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method): (i.e. generating samples from the distribution and computing their statistics directly)</li>\n",
    "    <li>integration by [numerical quadrature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration), (i.e. approximating the area under a curve by cutting it into a finite number of slithers that we then sum up).</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "Quadrature works very well for 1-D problem and this will be the focus of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "# PART 1 – Numerical quadrature #\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Introduction ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical quadrature is a form of numerical integration and can be used to integrate functions between definite limits, i.e. finding the area under a curve between a lower and upper limit on the x-axis. There are several different versions of the technique but they all work in the same way. The area under the curve is approximated by summing a series of segments whose area is easy to compute. In the simplest case the segments are very thin rectangles and the area under the curve can be approximated by summing the area of each of the rectangles shown. Note that the width of each rectangle is some fixed step size, and the heights are calculated by evaluating the function f(x) at the x position where the rectangle is centered. The area of each is simply the width times the height.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more rectangles we use, the thinner they will be and the closer the sum of their areas will be to the true area under the curve. i.e. by summing more rectangles we can improve the precision of the approximation – at the expense of additional computational effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Passing function as arguments ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Python already has functions for performing numeric integration but in order to get some more Python programing experience you are going to write your own. Your function needs to take four inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* f() - the function we wish to integrate,\n",
    "* a - the lower bound,\n",
    "* b - the upper bound and\n",
    "* N - the number of segments to be used to approximate the integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, the 1st parameter is a function – we are passing a function to a function. In Python it is possible to pass functions directly. Let’s illustrate this by passing the math.cos() function as a parameter to a function called squared that can compute the squared output of any function:\n",
    "First write the function squared like this\n",
    "\n",

    "    y = fn(x);\n",
