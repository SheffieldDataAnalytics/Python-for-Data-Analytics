A Python dictionary is another compound type, however it is inherently not ordered but it is instead a mapping type. The essential purpose of a dictionary is very simple: to associate *keys* and *values*. Keys can be strings (e.g. **\"bill\"**), or numbers (e.g. **55**), or even tuples (e.g. the tuple **'(\"bill\",\"bryson\")')**, but **not** ordinary lists. The stored values may be any Python value; strings and numbers are common cases. A key can be paired with *at most one* value, i.e. if we assign a new value to a key, its previous value is lost. \n",

Study the example thoroughly, and be sure you understand each step. When you've done so, try creating a dictionary of your own, to store phone numbers for a few people you know."
